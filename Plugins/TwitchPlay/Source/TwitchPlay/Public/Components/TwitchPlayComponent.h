 * You can still send and receive messages to/from channel chat.
 * Subscribe to OnMessageReceived to know when a message has harrived.
 * Subscribe to specific commands by registering with RegisterCommand() to receive events for that command.
 * Only one object/function per command can be subscribed. Might change in later versions of the API.
 * You can change the default characters for commands/options encapsulation via SetupEncasulationChars().
 * Remember to first Connect(), SetUserInfo() and then AuthenticateTwitchIRC() before trying to send messages.
